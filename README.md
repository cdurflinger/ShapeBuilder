# ShapeBuilder
ShapeBuilder takes a html canvas and allows you to draw shapes (squares/circles) and remove them from the canvas as needed. It is also mobile friendly and responsive. ShapeBuilder is my first solo JavaScript project. I have built many other things in the past but I was always able to look at someone elses code example when I became stuck.

# Getting Started
ShapeBuilder is not hosted on another platform such as Heroku so it must be ran on your local machine. Just clone this repository and run the index.html in your browser.

# Built With
No frameworks or libraries were used in this project. It is just built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
